## Nixalis Engine Introduction
The Nixalis engine is first and foremost a fun experience/project where I learn all kinds of new things during my coding 
journey. It provides insights into the C++ programming language, and uses different kinds of APIs and libraries.

My focus here is creating an engine from scratch using a graphics API, such as OpenGL and/or Vulka, where I will learn 
to render all kinds of stuff. My main focus is to create a 2D engine with custom APIs and eventually branch out to
3D rendering. First, I have to focus on learning how to build and manage an engine and focus mainly on all the different
concepts that are used in a general engine and facilitate certain external libraries.
